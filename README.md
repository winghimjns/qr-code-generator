# QR Code Generator

This isn't a creative project or anything new. I just want a little tool that helps.

When I need to share a URL to my mate's phone from desktop computer, either login to messaging account, email, or social media is annoying enough. How about just type a web link and paste the URL on it?

Alternatively, You may google "QR generator" and you will find something similar. But those ads slow down the page's downloading all the time.

This is what I have been thinking of for a while. I finally get a free weekend.


## Usage

As a small project, I would like to keep it simple. No compiling or anything else. I think everyone gets experience about using web browser would know how to use it. (??)


## Dependencies

This project is based on 2 code libraries:

- Wing.CSS (MIT License) (Just a little lightweight Stylesheet framework: https://kbrsh.github.io/wing/)
- qrcode.js (MIT License) (Main part if this small work: https://davidshimjs.github.io/qrcodejs/)
